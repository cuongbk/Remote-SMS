Remote SMS
==============
Remote SMS is an application for data exchange between smart phone Android and PC in wireless LAN.
Introduction
------------

Our application is designed by Android RF-Lab group (HUST) to help an user don't need to touch his phone but can exchange data (like SMS) on his working PC using wireless LAN connection between them.

Our application in smart phone receives a SMS and sends it to a PC using TCP protocol with wireless LAN connection established. And the user also can reply a SMS or sends a new one in his working PC and his phone will send it automatically. Additionally, this application can also receive and notify user to know whether answer the call or not.

Operating principle: Using TCP protocol (IP and port) based on TCP/IP to transmit and receive.
